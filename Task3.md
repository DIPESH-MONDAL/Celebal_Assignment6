# Create Incremental load pipeline and automate this on daily basis

[ref : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/tutorial-incremental-copy-portal]

### First we need to create data factory and then a pipeline within it.

Go to the Connection tab of SinkDataset and do the following steps:


For the File part of the File path field, select `Add dynamic content [Alt+P]`, and then enter `@CONCAT('Incremental-', pipeline().RunId, '.txt')`in the opened window. Then select Finish. The file name is dynamically generated by using the expression. Each pipeline run has a unique ID. The Copy activity uses the run ID to generate the file name.

### Schedule the Pipeline:
1. In the Data Factory, go to `Author > Triggers`.
2. Create a new trigger.
3. Set the trigger to run daily.
4. Attach the trigger to your pipeline.
